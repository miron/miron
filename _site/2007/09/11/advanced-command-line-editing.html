    : Today I passed my 117-201 exam and now I play a little bit with the Vi
: key bindings on Zsh. In Bash you can set them with set -o vi, and in Zsh you
: can set them additionally with setopt vi.
:
: I want to get to the point of command line editing above the basic
: tab complete and history browsing, searching and minor corrections. So  I
: start witch a little example:
:
: I want to rename a file with the following naming scheme:
:
: someID_filename.txt to filename.txt
:
: After my fulminant efficient Vim key combination for table editing, (<a href="http://princ3.wordpress.com/2007/06/13/vim-contest-who-finds-the-shortest-possible-solution-of-changing-an-postgre-tab-in-an-array/" title="Efficient table-editing" target="_blank">see this article</a>)
: I challenge everybody to find the shortest key combination to fulfill this
: task.
:
: I start with an self-deprating solution:
:
: First I type:
: mv someID_filname.txt
:
: Now the count begins:
:
: &lt;Space&gt;&lt;Esc&gt;T_y$$p&lt;Enter&gt;
:
: This makes a total of 9 characters which i have to store in my brain. As I want
: to have my head free for more complicated tasks, of course this has to
: be optimized dramatically :)
:
: Have fun.
