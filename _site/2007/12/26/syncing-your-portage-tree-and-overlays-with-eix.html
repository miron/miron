If you want to sync your portage tree and your layman-overlays with one command, you can use
<code>eix-sync</code>
for that.

All you have to do is to create
<code>/etc/eix-sync.conf</code>
and place a
<code>*</code>
in it.

If you want to have a cronjob  for that create for example a file named /etc/cron.weekly/eix.cron

and put something like

<code>#!/bin/sh
/usr/bin/eix-sync</code>

in it.

You can then delete all other cronjobs like emerge --sync and layman -S

As usual man eix has all the info you need.
