If you write a ToDo list or a schedule in vim, you probably want to insert the current date or the date after one week from now. Here is how to do:

:r !date

or to add one week to the current date:

:r !date -d "today 1 week"

enjoy :)<p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;">technorati tags:<a href="http://technorati.com/tag/vim" rel="tag">vim</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/insert" rel="tag">insert</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/date" rel="tag">date</a></p>
