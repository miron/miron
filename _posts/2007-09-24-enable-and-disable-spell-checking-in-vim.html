First you choose the language which you want to use:

:setlocal spell spelllang=en_us 

or 

:setlocal spell spelllang=de_at

For the German spell files you have to:

emerge vim-spell-de

You can disable spellchecking with:

:set nospell

]s move to next misspelled word, [s move to prev. misspelled word
z= suggests correctly spelled words under cursor,
1z= takes the first word from the suggestion list
^Xs does the same in insert mode.
:spellr repeats replacements done with z= for all matches

For more info about spellchecking in vim:

:h spell
