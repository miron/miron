  : I often cached myself renaming a file in some other directory like this,                                                                                                         
  : mv some/dir/some/file some/dir/some/file_renamed.                                                                                                                                                               
  :                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  : But there is an easier way:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
  : mv some/dir/some/{file,file_renamed}
  : 
  : This also works for copying:
  : cp /etc/mail/{sendmail.cf,sendmail.cf.orig}
  :
  : Or vimdiff:
  : vimdiff /etc/mail{sendmail.cf,sendmail.cf.orig}
  : 
  : And thats why I love zsh so much, you can even tabcomplete after the {, try that in bash f.e. :)
  : Be creative, I'm sure there are many useful fields of application
