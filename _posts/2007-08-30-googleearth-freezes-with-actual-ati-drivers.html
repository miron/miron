There is a library missing, libGL.so.1 see <a href="http://n01getsout.com/blog/2006/11/26/google-earth-for-linux-freezing-with-ati/" title="googleearth antifreeze" target="_blank">this</a> site for instructions.

Edit: Everything works fine for me now with latest googleearth (4.2.0198.2451 (beta)), no need to copy this library anymore as googleearth starts then in software-emulation mode.
